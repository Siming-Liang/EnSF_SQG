Code repository for the paper:
Nonlinear ensemble filtering with diffusion models:Application to the surface quasi-geostrophic dynamics

## How to use
first run `sqg_nature_run.py` to generate nature run. This code and LETKF codes are originally from https://github.com/jswhit/sqgturb

There are 4 experiments in the paper comparing LETKF and EnSF.

1. linear observation

2. linear observation + random model shocks

3. arctangent observation

4. 50% arctangent observation + 30% model shocks with probability of 10%
